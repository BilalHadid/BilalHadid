### About Me 🚀
Hi there! 👋 I’m Bilal Hadid, and I wear many hats in my tech journey. By day, I’m a Technical Manager at Devolic, where I lead the development of mobile apps, TV applications, websites, and dashboards. I manage both the backend and frontend teams, ensuring smooth project flow from planning to deployment — all while staying hands-on with the code myself. 🚀

But that’s not all! I’m also a Full Stack Developer with deep expertise in React Native, MERN Stack, Docker, and Kubernetes. Whether it’s crafting a sleek mobile experience, building powerful backends, or deploying scalable systems in the cloud, I love solving real-world problems through technology. 📱💻

At Devolic, I get to work on diverse projects — from apps you use on your phone to admin dashboards that power entire businesses. Leading a team while staying deeply technical gives me the best of both worlds, and I thrive on that challenge. 💪

Technology is my passion, and I’m always exploring new tools, frameworks, and ways to improve performance and user experience. Let’s connect and build something awesome together!
